To add options to comment and uncomment selections from the right-click context menu in Microsoft Visual Studio. Here’s how you can set it up:

Open Visual Studio: Start Visual Studio and open any project.
Customize the Toolbar:
- Go to Tools > Customize.
- Click on the Commands tab.
- Select the Context menu radio button.
- In the drop-down menu, choose Editor Context Menus | Code Window.
- Add Comment Commands:
- Click on the Add Command button.
- In the categories list, select Edit.
- From the commands list, find and select Comment Selection and then click OK.
- Repeat this step and add Uncomment Selection.
- Organize and Move Commands:
- Once you’ve added the commands, you can use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to position the commands where you want them in the context menu.
- Close the Customize Dialog:
- Click Close on the Customize dialog box to apply the changes.

NOTE:  When looking for the commands 'Comment Selection' and 'Uncomment Selection' I found those terms to be reversed in the listing.
Look for 'Selection Comment' and 'Selection Uncomment'.  Interestingly those should appear in the menu as described in the steps rather reversed as in the listing.
